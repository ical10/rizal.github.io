This Android app was built as an integral part of the whole Famtrack application: it helps families to locate their loved ones in real-time, to receive an instantaneous notification if a family pushed the panic button on the IoT device, and trigger the alarm on the same device if a travel agent suspects that one of his group member is missing during Hajj travel.
